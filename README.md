EulerPython
===========
Here are my Project Euler solutions in Python. The purpouse of the project is to try the Python language... Why is Pythons so popular? I do not know. But I wanna find out for myself. I decided to take the Project Euler problems and try to learn Python when solving this problems. Project Euler was hacked recently so they do not allow to check the solutions. After they will fix the site I will fix potential issues in the commited code. I have already solved around 70 of the problems few years back so solving them once more time should be easier. Usually I develop stuff in Java and I also like Ruby language. Im trying this on my laptop, it has W8.1. I am developing in Sublime Text and compiling using Python 3. I did not use Python before this project. I heard about Python before and saw some code.

Diary
=====
Day 1
-----
Ok, I choosed Python 3 as its said on the pages that Python 2 is legacy. It is strange that python executable has diffent mode when you run it without arguments and when you run it to run a program. It took me some time to figure this out. At the end I ended with finally buying a Sublime Text 2 licence so that I can try it out as well. I set up some Python3 build system, Python needed to be in path for it to work. Now I press ctrl+b and I see output of the Python program. 

Problem one is easy one. I learned how to create *function*, how to do a simple *for cycle*, *if* statement and *printing*.
Day 2
-----
Problem two is easy as well. Nothing to think about here, simple cycle will do. I learned how to do *while* cycle.
Day 3
-----
Finaly some playing with primes in problem three. As I remember from few years back, there will be a lot of prime problems ahead of me, so I created the Sieve of Eratosthenes function. It probably is somewhere in python ecosystem already, but I am not that far yet. This is the first time I used *import* to successfully import math module. I learned how to print *last element of array*.
Day 4
-----
Problem four let me play with *converting int to string* as well as *reversing the string*.
Day 5
-----
Ok, so I will need the sieve I created on Day 3 again. Time to create *my own module*. It took me some time to find out how exactly call the methods from my imported module. At the end it is of course trivial - name_of_module.name_of_method. I will leave the code in problem3.py as well for historical purposes. It is also the first time i am working with *set*. The solution of the fifth problem that I chosed could be probably improved, but I am not here for the perfection. 
Day 6
-----
Problem six is not interesting at all. Easy solution, nothing to learn here.
Day 7
-----
This problem is probably wants us to finally create the sieve. I already have it, so again easy solution not much to learn here. 
Day 8
-----
I decided to version the progress. I created github repository and put the code inside. In problem 8 I was practicing how to *work with characters of a string* and convert *string to integer*. To be honest I do not like the global methods - len, str, int. I am used to have this methods on my objects from ruby - size/lenght is attribute of an object why is len a global function? 
Day 9
-----
I had a chance to *sort an array* in Python when solving problem 9. I was again surprised that the sorted method flies in the air in global namespace.
Day 10
------
Another easy problem if you already have the sieve.
Day 11
------
I have learned how to *initialize array of arrays*. Also I learned that Python does not like number 04.
Day 12
------
I decided to do share the diary.
